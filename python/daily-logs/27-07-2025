Topics Covered
Python Strings

String Length (len())

String Modification Methods:

.upper(), .lower(), .capitalize(), .title(), .strip()

String Concatenation (+, , in print())

String Slicing ([start:stop:step])

String Reversal using slicing ([::-1])

Escape Characters (\n, \t, \\, \', \")

String Formatting:

Using +, , in print()

f-strings (f"Hello {name}")

.format() method

🧪 Practice
Printed and manipulated string variables with different methods

Calculated string lengths using len()

Practiced slicing on names and phrases (first name, last character, skipping characters, reverse string)

Used escape characters to format output

Used different string formatting methods to personalize output

🧩 Mini Projects
Name_Formatter: Took user name input and returned it in uppercase, reversed, and proper case using various methods

String_Analyzer: Took a sentence and printed:

Length

Uppercase version

Reversed sentence

First 5 and last 5 characters

Welcome_Message_Generator: Used f-strings and escape characters to format multi-line welcome messages

⚠️ Challenges
Getting comfortable with slicing syntax

Remembering which methods return new strings vs. change in-place (strings are immutable!)

Forgetting f"" in f-strings caused syntax issues initially

📅 Plan for Tomorrow
Learn about:

Arithmetic and comparison operators

Logical operators (and, or, not)

Conditional statements (if, else, elif)

📝 Notes
Strings are immutable — string methods return new strings

len() gives the number of characters, including spaces

[::-1] is the simplest way to reverse a string

Escape characters help format text nicely (\n = newline, \t = tab)

f-strings are preferred over + or .format() for readability
