2025-07-28 Day 3 Log

Topics Covered
-Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
-Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
-Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.
-Logical operators: and, or, not
-Operator precedence and combining expressions
-Using operators with numbers and strings

Practice Highlights
-Evaluated mathematical expressions using arithmetic operators
-Compared values using comparison operators
-Combined multiple conditions using logical operators
-Practiced assignment shortcuts like +=, *=, etc.
-Tested operator precedence in complex expressions

Mini Projects
-Basic_Calculator
-Smart_String_Analyzer_Tool
-Fake_Email_Formatter_Validator
-Password_Obfuscator_Tool

Challenges Faced
-Confusion between / (true division) and // (floor division)
-Accidentally using = instead of == in comparisons
-Remembering correct order of operations
-Combining and, or, not logically in expressions

Notes
-/ returns float, // returns integer division result
-% gives remainder, ** is exponentiation
-Use parentheses () to control evaluation order
-Logical operators return Boolean values (True/False)
-Combining conditions makes code more dynamic and powerful

Plan for Day 4
-Conditional statements: if, elif, else
-Nesting conditions
-Writing decision-based mini tools
